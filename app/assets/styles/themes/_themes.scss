// This is the main file in the themes folder, we import all the files we want
// to use from this folder here.

// Color Palettes
// In color palettes we override color variables in a class basis
// That allows us to use different color palettes just by switching a class

// Type Systems
// In type systems we override typography variables for some classes
// That allows us to override typography settings in a module
